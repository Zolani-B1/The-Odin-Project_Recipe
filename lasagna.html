        <li><span><strong>Fresh produce:</strong> Aside from the zucchini, you'll also need a green bell peper, an union, and mushrooms from the produce aisle.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Frezen spinach:</strong></span> Frozen spinach is a convenient, colorful, and nutrient-rich ingredient.</li>
        <li><span><strong>tomato products:</strong></span> A combination tomato paste and tomato sauce.</li>
        <li><span><strong>Wine:</strong></span> red wine enhence the overall flavor.</li>
        <li><span><strong>Cheese:</strong></span> You'll need low-fat ricotta cheese, mozarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li><span><strong>Egg:</strong></span> An egg adds moisture and helps bind the ricotta mixture together, preventing runnines.</li>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <li><strong>Step1</strong> Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a deep 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Step2</strong> Slice zucchini lengthwise into very thin slices. Sprinkle slices lightly with salt; set aside to drain in a colander.</li>
        <li><strong>Step3</strong> To prepare the meat sauce, cook ground beef and black pepper in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add green pepper and onion; cook and stir until meat is no longer pink.</li>
        <li><strong>Step4</strong> Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, wine, basil, and oregano; add a small amount of hot water if sauce is too thick. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer sauce for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li><strong>Step5</strong> Meanwhile, stir ricotta, egg, and parsley together in a bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Step6</strong> To assemble lasagna, spread 1/2 of the meat sauce over the bottom of the prepared pan. Layer with 1/2 of the zucchini slices, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, all of the spinach, followed by all of the mushrooms, then 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat by layering in the remaining meat sauce, zucchini slices, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella.</li>
        <li><strong>Step7</strong> Spread parmesan evenly over the top; cover with foil.</li>
        <li><strong>Step8</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove foil; raise oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake an additional 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step9</strong> Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li><strong>Step10</strong> Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
